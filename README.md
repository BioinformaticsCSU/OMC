# OMC

We propose overlap matrix completion algorithm in bilayer network (OMC2) and in tri-layer network (OMC3) to predict potential drug-associated indications, respectively. The codes are implemented in Matlab2014a.

Description: 
"Demo_OMC2.m" demonstrates the experimental result on the gold standard dataset by OMC2 algorithm.

"Demo_OMC3.m" demonstrates the experimental result on the gold standard dataset by OMC3 algorithm.

"BNNR.m" is the function of BNNR algorithm.

"svt.m" is the function of singular value thresholding operator.

"KNN_drugS.m" is the function of KNN Preprocessing based on drug similarity matrix.

"KNN_diseaseS.m" is the function of KNN Preprocessing based on disease similarity matrix.
