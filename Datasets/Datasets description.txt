Overlap Matrix Completion (OMC) can conduct drug-disease prediction on three datasets: Fdataset, Cdataset, and DNdataset, which can be loaded by matlab.

(1) Fdataset
Wrname: the DrugBank IDs of drugs;
Wdname: the OMIM IDs of diseases;
drug: drug similarity matrix;
disease: disease similarity matrix;
didr: disease-drug association matrix.

(2) Fdataset_Matrix_DrProA_DrugBank
drugID_sort: the DrugBank IDs of drugs, assigned number;
proteinID_dr_sort: the Uniprot IDs of proteins, assigned number;
dr_pro_pair: drug-protein interaction pairs are represented by assigned number pairs;
Matrix_dr_pro_associ: drug-protein interaction matrix;
data: the DrugBank IDs of drugs,the Uniprot IDs of proteins.

(3) Fdataset_Matrix_DisProA_CTDomim
omimID_sort:  the OMIM IDs of diseases, assigned number;
proteinID_dis_sort: the Uniprot IDs of proteins, assigned number;
dis_pro_pair: disease-protein association pairs are represented by assigned number pairs;
Matrix_dis_pro_associ: disease-protein association matrix;
data2: the OMIM IDs of diseases, gene IDs, the Uniprot IDs of proteins.

(4) Cdataset
Wrname: the DrugBank IDs of drugs;
Wdname: the OMIM IDs of diseases;
drug: drug similarity matrix;
disease: disease similarity matrix;
didr: disease-drug association matrix.

(5) Cdataset_Matrix_DrProA_DrugBank
drugID_sort: the DrugBank IDs of drugs, assigned number;
proteinID_dr_sort: the Uniprot IDs of proteins, assigned number;
dr_pro_pair: drug-protein interaction pairs are represented by assigned number pairs;
Matrix_dr_pro_associ: drug-protein interaction matrix;
data: the DrugBank IDs of drugs,the Uniprot IDs of proteins.

(6) Cdataset_Matrix_DisProA_CTDomim
omimID_sort:  the OMIM IDs of diseases, assigned number;
proteinID_dis_sort: the Uniprot IDs of proteins, assigned number;

(7) DNdataset
Wrname: the names of drugs;
Wdname: the names of diseases;
drug: drug similarity matrix;
disease: disease similarity matrix;
protein: protein-prottein interaction matrix;
didr: disease-drug association matrix;
protein_disease: protein-disease association matrix;
drug_protein: drug-protein interaction matrix.
